# Optimal_Routing With Genetic Algorithm
This is a program that calculates and finds the most optimal cost in a routing problem. The routing problem is described as having a Producer called DC, Distributors called Satelites, and Retailers. The problems comes by finding the optimal cost effective route from the DC to the Satellites, and from the Satellite  to the Retailers.

DC to Satelites

Satelites to Retailers

Conditions
The problem comes that from the DC to the Satellite uses a vehicle that can travel to a single route, while the vehicle from the Satelite to the retail uses a vehicle that can travel to multiple retailers in a single path.
Each Retailers have different Demands
There are 2 types of vehicle both have different cost and capacity
No all Satellite is required to be used
There is a cost in renting a Satellite which is taken in to account the total cost

The Goal is to find a path and the number of vehicle needed and the number of satelite needed to satisfy all retailers

The solution used in this program uses Genetic Algorithm.
